# Contributing Guidelines

## Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to ShoppIt. It is with your help that we are able to build a strong and healthy app.

There are many ways you can contribute to our open source project. The most useful being:
submitting a bug report, improving the documentation or writing code which we can add to the application. However if those don’t suit you can always contribute by submitting a feature request. Please follow the guidelines below to make the contribution process as easy as possible. 

>Note: Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions.

## Code of conduct

* Be nice and respectful to your fellow developers.
* Make sure to reference any material used.
* There is a zero tolerance policy on hate speech, harassment or any other form of toxic behaviour
* Keep all comments related to the project. 
* Be constructive and polite regarding any feedback/criticism.

## Quick start

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:
1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
* Be sure you have followed the code and commit style for the project.
* Send a pull request.

## How to report a bug

If you think you have found a bug, first make sure that you are testing against the latest version. They can include bugs in the code as well as documentation issues.

Before submitting, check if the bug you are reporting already exists in the issue tracker. If it doesn’t, submit an issue and select ‘bug report’. Fill out the bug report template with the relevant information in each of the fields. Making sure to submit as much information as possible so that the bug can be replicated by the person fixing it. Be sure to select relevant labels before submitting. 


## How to suggest a feature

For a new feature request, the issue should describe the new feature and why it is needed.

Before suggesting, check the open issues if the feature you are requesting already exists. If it doesn’t, submit an issue and select ‘feature request’. Fill out the feature request template with the relevant information in each of the fields. Be sure to select relevant labels before submitting. 


## Code review process

Our team will regularly look at the pull requests submitted. If at least one member reviews and approves your request then you will be able to merge your contribution. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity. It is expected that all members review all approved pull requests at the start of each work session to catch up on recent changes.

## How to set up your environment and run tests

## Code, commit message and labelling conventions

>Labelling and code conventions TBH

Below are the commit guidelines for our project:
https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53
https://github.com/frissyn/commit-prefixes

Code should be formatted using VSCode default formatting conventions.

Pull requests should have a title which summarises the changes. The body should provide more details about what changes have been made and should reference the number of the associated issue, e.g., "Fixed synchronisation issue closes #123". The title of the pull request should not just reference the issue number – it should succinctly describe the actual changes.
